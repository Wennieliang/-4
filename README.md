                                Studying people, attending to detail, carefully observing and listening
                  
            Last year, when I studied English in Guangzhou, China for papering the Ielts test, I met my teacher Amy, who was 23 years old. In next the six months, she was one of the teachers in charged of 10 students in class, gradually became my friend instead of a teacher. Every day, we shared our experiences in life and talked joys and she guided to acquire knowledge.
          One day, I was thinking  maybe we can be true friends, which is not the relationship only depends on words. So, I wanted to learn more about her, because if we really wanted to be a good friend, we should know each better. I decidedto keep my eyes on her her from that day, when I do not sure if she has the same ideas to become a  real friend.
       
       First, I wanted to know what is her characteristics, and what the differences when she behaved in the classroom or at home. So, I started to spy how she  behaves and  emotion changing. In the morning, when she stepped into the classroom, I noticed that her eyes downcast and lips pouted, looked like as if the next shot would have shown her crying, and her face messed up, felt like she suffered troubles for a long time. Meanwhile, she would sigh frequently no matter how the wonderful things happened. At noon, my classmates and I kept to ask her if she wanted to eat lunch with us, however, every time, she would say no without reasons. when I looked into her facebook, she post videos and commentedthem about the emotion issues in the relationship of girlfriend or boyfriend. At the afternoon, she helped students with their essays. We had to finish our essay at the night before the class day, because she would have enough time to  modify our essay in the beginning of the class, which could help us to save us time comparing to let students wrote their essay in the class. Every time, when she found out some grammar mistakes or some sentences that didn’t make senses, she would shout at us with a dismissive tone, “what a stupid mistake! How could you make this type of mistakes that a kindergarten child wouldn’t make! ”.  And later, she would take a deep breath, and smoothly said “Okkk! Today, I’m not gonna to mad at you guys, but the point is you are going to jot down the grammar mistakes that you made and correct them, at the same time, using this grammar to make ten sentences or you are free to go, and cannot go back here again!”
         Through those things, I  know what she really be in life. And I guess she liked to stay at her room and did not  like to talk  with anybody when she was not in teaching, including her family members, because she had taking at workd and shot at us all the day. I could conclude that she maybe was not happy in her daily life, and with a dispositive relationship with her family because of lacking communication. 
        Besides, she might have a bad realationship with  her boyfriend duing talking and sharing thoughts. Although I could not figure out whether she has a boyfriend or not if I did not ask her face-to-face, I swear that I did could hear that there was a voice inside my head and told me I was right and should trust my precisely instinct. I did follow what my heart believes.
        Half year later, I finished my Ielts test and it is the time to say good-bye to classmates and teachers in Guangzhou. before the day I left the Guangzhou, Amy invited me and my classmates to have a dinner in a restaurant. she asked me with a smile “ So, before you left, could you tell me you have any comments on me?”  I told her all the thought that I ever had at her. After Amy and my classmates heard my story, they looked surprised and Amy talked to me in embarrassed “ Wooww! How could you know me so well? You know! Even myself can’t noticed all those things that you have mentioned, but the only things I can say that all the stuff were true!”
      After I came to Vanouver, we still kept in tough on Wechat, an app similar to Facebook, and share our own stories in different countries and be friends forever!
